# **Docs-App-Concept** 📝  

This repository contains a **concept design for a Notes Doc App**, built with **React**. The app showcases **drag-and-drop functionality** using **Framer Motion** to provide smooth animations and interactive UI elements. It's intended as a creative exploration of a simple notes app where notes can be freely moved across the screen.
